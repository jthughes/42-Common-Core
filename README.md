# 42-Common-Core
22 January 2024 I started the 42 Piscine at the [42 Adelaide](https://www.42adel.org.au/) campus. 28 days later, I had finished the Piscine and two weeks later I kicked off my time in the Common Core studies as I work to deepen my programming knowledge and hone my skills. Here I intend to document my journey, highlighting the concepts each project aims to teach, and reflect on the other things I learn along the way.
