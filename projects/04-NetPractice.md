# 04 - NetPractice
## The Project
The NetPractice project provides a small simulation of different simple networks, where some portion of IP addresses, subnet masks, and/or routes are provided, and the student must fill in the rest of the detail to configure valid networks that allow designated devices to communicate with each other and/or the internet.

## Research 

## What I learned
- Routers can interface with/between multiple different network groups
